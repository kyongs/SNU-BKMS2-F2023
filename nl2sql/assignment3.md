# Assignment 3. How to Train ChatGPT for NL2SQL
This week, we will test how much more accurately ChatGPT can generate answers when additional information is provided through a simple schema. <br/>



## Natural Language Queries
1. Find the average total credits over all prior years.

## Submission Guide
1. Name of file should be “Assignment3-studentID.pdf”. (-10 points if the file format is not pdf) <br/>
2. The report should include three steps for each problem.
i) Ask ChatGPT to generate a query without giving any schema information.
ii) Ask ChatGPT to generate a query with schema information.
iii) Give some additional information to ChatGPT to make the query more accurate. <br/>
3. If a query created by ChatGPT doesn't work, prompt it to provide a proper query by entering additional
information in the prompt, and document this process in a report. (If not, -10 points per problem) <br/>
4. Make sure your report includes analysis of results. (If not, -20 points) <br/>
5. Late submissions are penalized by 20% of total grade per day. <br/>
