# Assignment 3. How to Train ChatGPT for NL2SQL
This week, we will test how much more accurately ChatGPT can generate answers when additional information is provided through a simple schema. <br/>
Change *5 natural language queries* to *SQL queries* using ChatGPT.<br/>
You should prompt ChatGPT in three steps and analyze the result in the report.
    i) Ask ChatGPT to generate a SQL query **without giving any schema information**.
    ii) Ask ChatGPT to generate a SQL query **with schema information**.
    iii) Give **some additional information**(i.e., explanation of table schema, PK/FK relationship, etc.) to ChatGPT to make the SQL query more accurate. <br/>
To verify if the SQL query generated by ChatGPT is correct, use LiveSQL.
