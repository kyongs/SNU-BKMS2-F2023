It offers managed services and complete systems, including hardware and software platforms.As the creators of the dynamic speed bumpActibumpand the smart city platformEdevaLive, the Edeva team works mainly for municipal, regional, and national road administrations, toll stations, environmental agencies, and law enforcement agencies.The team also solves many other problems, from obtaining large amounts of environmental data for decision-making to developing a screening scale to help law enforcement agencies assess vehicle overloading. The latter, for instance, decreased the amount of time needed to control each vehicle, speeding up traffic checks and allowing law enforcement agencies to control more vehicles.About the TeamTheteam at Edevais a small but impactful group of 11 working on everything from creating hardware IoT devices to analyzing time-series data and making it accessible to customers—and, sometimes—the public.As a software architect, I am in charge of building the best possible solution to receive, store, analyze, visualize, and share the customers’ event data. Our team then comes together to create solutions that work and that the customer actually wants.About the ProjectEdeva has created a dynamic speed bump calledActibumpand the smart city platformEdevaLive.The Actibump has been used in Sweden since 2010. Speeding vehicles activate a hatch in the road that lowers a few centimeters, creating an inverted speed bump. Providing good accessibility for public transportation, such as buses and emergency vehicles, the Actibump still ensures a safe speed for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. It is also an environmentally friendly solution, helping decrease noise and emissions.The Actibump can be combined with the EdevaLive system, delivering valuable remote monitoring services and statistics to Edeva’s customers.Most of the data we collect is based on IoT devices:Traffic flow data: The Actibump measures the speed of oncoming traffic to decide if it needs to activate the speed bump or not.', metadata={'title': 'How Edeva Uses Continuous Aggregations and IoT to Build Smarter Cities', 'url': 'https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-edeva-uses-continuous-aggregations-and-iot-to-build-smarter-cities/'}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"re being more responsible users of TimescaleDB. We’re at that sweet spot within TimescaleDB where it’s found product-market fit within Density.Brock:It’s hard to name my favorite TimescaleDB feature, but continuous aggregates have been a game-changer in a variety of different ways. Early on, whenever we first onboarded to TimescaleDB and deployed, it made development significantly faster, and we could just offload a lot of decision logic and complexity around time zone handling and bucketing (that’s a big one) to TimescaleDB and let it handle that complexity for us.Continuous aggregates come into play in that we were able to roll up multiple resolutions of our sensor account data, our people count data, and make that available in a much more efficient way with little-to-no effort so far as the code that we actually had to write to deliver those efficiencies.Continuous aggregates are becoming less important for us now than they were in our previous usage, just because as Shane was talking about earlier on, we're growing to such a size, and our use cases are becoming so complex that we're wanting to move to more the ETL (extract, transform, load) type of processing out of the database. So we're not monopolizing database resources to do some of those computations and move them upstream of the database into processing pipelines and still take advantage of continuous aggregates but to a lesser degree. We're doing less of the mathematical stuff in the database, but we're still using continuous aggregates to roll up high-resolution data to lower resolutions.Advice & ResourcesBrock:If I had to recommend resources, the first would probably be theTimescale blog. It’s been historically pretty informative over the years about the internals, like what’s happening in TimescaleDB underpinning a specific feature. One that I remember specifically is explaining thevarious compression algorithms in play for different data types within PostgreSQL. Being able to distill that knowledge down to a blog article that I could consume and then assimilate into my mental model of what was going on under the covers of the technology I was using has been helpful repeatedly.The advice that I would give for building a scalable database or a strategy around that is that when designing for an analytic workload specifically, don't direct any read load to the master or in standby notes. Always use a read replica for enough reasons that we probably don't\", metadata={'title': 'How Density Manages Large Real Estate Portfolios Using TimescaleDB', 'url': 'https://www.timescale.com/blog/density-measures-large-real-estate-portfolios-using-timescaledb/'}),\n"," Document(page_content=\"aledb.continuous) AS\\n SELECT actibump_id,\\n timescaledb_experimental.time_bucket_ng(INTERVAL '1 month', time, 'UTC') AS bucket,\\n percentile_agg(vehicle_speed_initial) AS percentile_agg\\nFROM vehicles\\nGROUP BY actibump_id, bucketAnd this is the query that fetches the data for the graph:SELECT TIMESCALEDB_EXPERIMENTAL.TIME_BUCKET_NG(INTERVAL '1 month', bucket) AS date,\\nactibump_id,\\nAPPROX_PERCENTILE(0.85, ROLLUP(PERCENTILE_AGG)) AS p85,\\nMAX(signpost_speed_max)\\nFROM vehicles_summary_1_month\\nWHERE actibump_id in ('16060022')\\nAND bucket >= '2021-01-30 23:00:00'\\nAND bucket <= '2022-04-08 21:59:59'\\nGROUP BY date, actibump_id\\nORDER BY date ASCHere is an example of the graph:At the moment, we use PHP and Yii 2 to deploy TimescaleDB. We connect to TimescaleDB with Qlik Sense for business analytics. In Qlik Sense, you can easily connect to TimescaleDB using the PostgreSQL integration.It is especially convenient to be able to connect to the continuous aggregations for long-term data without overloading the system with too much raw data. We often use Qlik Sense to rapidly prototype graphs that we later add to EdevaLive.Advice and ResourcesThe next step for us is to come up with a good way of reducing the amount of raw data we store in TimescaleDB. We are looking at how we can integrate it with a data lake.
